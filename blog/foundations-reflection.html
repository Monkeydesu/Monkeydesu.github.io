    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>That I don’t have much of an ego (already knew this). That I didn’t learn anything new during core. </p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>Not just in learning and programming, but these things matter to all aspects of life. Values matter because you should always stay true to yourself. Self-awareness because we all have flaws and are usually 90% the reason for our own suffering, we should all learn to take accountability for our own actions. And empathy is the most important because we are social creatures and need each other, the world is tough enough without making it harder for other people.</p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>Nothing.</p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>Nothing.</p>

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>Because that’s what corporate culture has turned into, especially tech companies. </p>

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>I graduated with a BA, so I’ve done electives in psychology, educational psychology, public speaking, etc. Also during my time at Uni I got interested in neuroscience, meditation, and learning about the self. Plus I think naturally I’m a very introspective person.</p>
