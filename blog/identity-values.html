        <p>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.<br>
        I think being a teacher in Japan for 7 years forced me to make ethical decisions every day. Being a teacher might be the most important job in modern society, you can create lifetime memories and examples in the future through the kids.
        Like every teacher the first goal is to teacher the children, my second goal with my students was for them to be better versions of themselves. For a little while I worked at a rough school that had major problems with bullying. I saw it as my job to help the students, and I was always there for them when they needed me. I think a lot of them looked up to me, I was a foreigner from overseas and came with new ways of thinking. I think I gave some of them a role model. I worked hard for them, showed them I cared, even on the hard days, I didn’t falter for them. On my last day of school a lot of the students thanked me and said they would love to visit New Zealand because of me. That really touched me.</p>
        
        <p>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.<br>
        New Zealand is known to have a blunt approach to life, and a “she’ll be right” attitude. I think I do align with these values and I’m proud of it.</p>
        
        <p>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.<br>
        I’m creative and forward. I will ask anything to anyone without hesitation, and this has helped a lot in my learning journey through life.</p>
        
        <p>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?<br>
        Limitations are things you put on yourself, and I think me knowing this won’t stop me from trying anything.<br>
        My dream was to move and live in Japan, and I accomplished that dream. Me doing this showed myself that I can do anything if I put in my full heart into the task.</p>
        
        <p>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.<br>
        Working in Japan with Japanese people I had resistance at first, because my ideas went against the norm. I had to learn a lot about Japanese work culture.<br>
        When I could feel tension rising, I would mentally step back and ask “what I was doing to make this situation bad, and what could I do to make it better”? I think when I started taking responsibility in these situations my relationship with my co-workers improved dramatically. I also think my co-workers started learning about me, I have a good heart and I mean well, I’m just from a different culture and sometimes see things differently.</p>]
