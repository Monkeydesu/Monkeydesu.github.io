        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
        <p>It can help people move away from the belief of a “fixed mindset”, and removes mental barriers for people to achieve what they want in life.</p>
        <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
        <p>Practice, practice, practice. That’s what they say, right? </p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>Mindful practice is the most effective way. Also learning/researching about the importance of a growth mindest.</p>
        <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
        <p>A book a read in University 10 years ago was called “Sane New World: Taming The Mind” by Ruby Wax. She is a famous comedian who studied mindfulness-based cognitive therapy at Oxford University. This was the first time I had heard about neuroplasticity.</p>

        <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>The more you do an activity, the more your brain synapses fire together, strengthening their connection. This is effective rewiring your brain. The more you do something, the less conscious strain it costs. So it’s important to spend mindful practice on stuff that is important to you on a daily basis.</p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>Nope.</p>
        <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
        <p>By doing what I normally do. I already had learnt about this in University. Also living in Japan, the culture strongly believes in learnt skill over natural talent. There is no direct translation in Japanese as “good luck”. In Japan they say “ganbatte” which translates to “try your hardest!” SO after years of hearing, “ganbatte”, I think it’s seeped into my unconscious. 
            What is that famous quote, “luck is for the ill-prepared”.</p>

        <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
        <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
        <p>It won’t. I already learnt about this years ago. Just study/practice more.</p>
