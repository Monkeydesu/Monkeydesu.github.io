    <h1>EQ vs IQ</h1>
    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) is very important in the corporate world and it probably the most defining factor when 
        it comes to success. It’s the ability to perceive, interpret and control your emotions and the emotions of others 
        effectively.<br>
        There is a famous quote that goes, “Remember that 80% of the success in any job is based on your ability to deal 
        with people.” I think you could even argue that it’s higher than 80%.
    </p>
    <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>
        EQ stands for “emotional intelligence”, while IQ stands for “intelligence quotient”. EQ focuses more on understanding 
        emotions in a given situation, your own and the other people involved. IQ is more reasoning and logical ability.

    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <p>
        These days there has been shift in promoting diversity in work environments. While this is always a good thing, having 
        people with different perspectives can cause conflict. This is why we need to encourage EQ in the work place. It’s important 
        to be able to step back and see/understand where people are coming from. This will lead to a healthier and more productive team.
        Also research has been done that has found EQ, rather than IQ, to be a high predictor when it comes to higher income and 
        career success.
