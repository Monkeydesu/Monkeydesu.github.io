        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

            <p>What is your long term goal or career pathway?<br>
            I lived in Japan and speak Japanese. I love the culture of Japan, so if I could work in a New Zealand company with Japanese business partners or vice versa. Also I do have an interest in 	the gaming community. So if I could transition into the game coding, I think that would make me rather happy.</p>
        
            <p>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.<br>
            I think I bring good energy to a team.<br>
            For limitations, it might be time management.</p>
        
            <p>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br>
            I’ve reached a point in my life where I am very happy with who I am. I do continue to try to be a better person every day for the people around me. I don’t think Dev Academy can teach me what I want when it comes to self love.</p>
        
            <p.>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br>
            My only commitment is Dev Academy while I study. I can fully commit to this.</p.>
        
            <p>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.<br>
            If I have doubt if something is “safe”, I’ll ask a facilitator before going ahead.</p>
        
            <p>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.<br>
            Go for a walk and get fresh air.</p>
        
            <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.<br>
            On the Dev Academy discord? I also have other IT friends.</p>
        
            <p>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.<br>
            To be there to support us and to answer any stupid questions I have.</p>
        
            <p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.<br>
            Nope, nothing.</p>
