    <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>The three languages are the building blocks for any website. They are all treated equally,
        but each do an important things. HTML defines the structure of the website. CSS styles
        the website and lets the HTML elements look prettier. And Javascript does all the cool stuff,
        such as play media, fancy navigation, more interactive options, etc. 
    </p>
    <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
    <p>
        By default Javascript code is executed from top to bottom, line by line however we can change this with Control Flow.
        Control flow allows our program to make decisions about what code is executed and when. Doing this will gives our program
        the ability to change to conditions and intelligently automate repetitive tasks. This is done by using conditional statements
        and loops:<br>

        <u>Conditional Statements:</u><br>These are basically checks to see if a certain condition is either true or false.
        If the condition is true then run code A, if it’s false then run code B. There are if statements, switch, and ternary.<br>

        <u>JavaScript Loops:</u><br> Loops allow us to perform repetitive tasks with less code. For example using loops we can
        iterate over an array and perform some sort of action on each piece of data in the array, or we can use a loop to compile
        a list of all the items. There are for loops, do/while loops, for...in, and for..of.
    </p>
    <h2>Arrays, and objects</h2>
    <p>
        If you have a list of items, storing each item individually would look messy and take up a lot of code, especially if you have 
        thousands and thousands items of data. So we have arrays which store multiple values by referring to an index number. The index 
        number is where they are stored on the list, and the index value starts at ‘0’. Arrays are a special type of object.<br>

        An object is a variable, but they can contain many values, such as firstName, lastName, age, eyeColor, etc. This makes 
        it easier for us to sort and track all these values, especially if we plan to use them again in the future. We can reference 
        the object and don’t have to spend time coding out all the information again and again.<br>
        They can also contain functions, which we call ‘methods’. 
    </p>
    <h2>Functions and why they are useful</h2>
    <p>
        Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript. They are basically a set of statements that 
        perform a task or calculates a value. 
    </p>
    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>
        What your browser displays is a web document. This is the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If we dig a little 
        deeper we can see a hierarchical structure that your browser uses to make sense of everything. This structure is called 
        the <em>Document Object Model</em> or the DOM. Everything that makes up your DOM is called a‘ node’.
