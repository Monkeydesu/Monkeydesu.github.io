  <h1>Problem Solving!</h1>
  <body>
    <container class="blog_page">
        <h2>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
        <p><u>What was the problem?</u></p>
        <p>The object grade-book challenge in JavaScript Kata.</p>
        <p><u>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</u></p>
        <p>Tried a bunch of different ideas, console logging, a lot of Googling and then lastly asking a coach.</p>
        <p><u>How did you feel throughout the process?</u></p>
        <p>Fine. Not overwhelmed or frustrated.</p>
        <p><u>What did you learn?</u></p>
        <p>In JavaScript you use {} for objects and [] for arrays.</p>

        <h2>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
        <p><u>What was the problem?</u></p>
        <p>The Javascript-kata builtin filter challenge.</p>
        <p><u>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</u></p>
        <p>A lot of mentioned above. But I ended up finding a YouTube video which helped me out.</p>
        <p><u>How did you feel throughout the process?</u></p>
        <p>It was actually fun. I enjoy problem solving.</p>
        <p><u>What did you learn?</u></p>
        <p>How to use the filter method.</p>

        <h2>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
        <p><u>Out of 10:</u></p>
        <p><u>Pseudocode</u></p>
        <p>2 / 10</p>
        <p><u>Trying something</u></p>
        <p>10 / 10 (I enjoy coming up with ideas, I have a lot of ideas)</p>
        <p><u>Rubber ducky method</u></p>
        <p>2 / 10</p>
        <p><u>Reading error messages</u></p>
        <p>3 / 10</p>
        <p><u>Console.logging</u></p>
        <p>10 / 10</p>
        <p><u>Googling</u></p>
        <p>10 / 10</p>
        <p><u>Asking your peers for help</u></p>
        <p>1 / 10 (I don’t want to annoy people)</p>
        <p><u>Asking coaches for help</u></p>
        <p>10 / 10</p>
        <p><u>Improving your process with reflection</u></p>
        <p>3 / 10 </p>
        
        <h2>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h2>
        <p>Asking in general can be difficult. But during this week I realized I’m paying a lot of money to be at this 
            boot camp, so my reluctances disappeared immediately. I’m not going to be sshy about asking for anything 
            any more!</p>
